[00:18.27] Silly boy, don't talk to me
[00:22.54] I don't have the energy
[00:27.07] Please don't ask to dance with me tonight
[00:47.57] 
[00:36.07] I do better on my own (on my own)
[00:40.58] I don't mean to come off cold (come off cold)
[00:44.93] But my dear, I'm all danced out tonight
[01:04.43] 
[00:53.83] Now the gin is hitting me
[00:58.38] And it's almost half-past three
[01:02.86] Am I crazy or seeing things?
[01:06.42] I'm sorry if I can't go for another swing
[01:26.92] 
[01:11.47] You're a charmer, that's for sure
[01:15.82] But I can't stand anymore
[01:20.36] Shame I would've danced with you tonight
[01:26.60] (Dance with you tonight)
[01:38.60] 
[01:29.27] Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[01:33.73] Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[01:38.06] Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[01:52.56] 
[01:47.27] Now the gin is hitting me
[01:51.42] And it's almost half-past three
[01:56.09] Am I crazy or seeing things?
[01:59.83] I'm sorry if I can't go for another swing
[02:20.33] 
[02:05.02] You're a charmer, that's for sure
[02:09.27] But I can't stand anymore
[02:13.62] Shame I would've danced with you tonight
[02:33.62] 
[02:24.03] Would've danced with you tonight
