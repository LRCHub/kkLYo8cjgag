Scarlett lips, a silk embrace
But there's no laughter in her face
A crowded room is a lonely place full of lies

A wicked smile a shifting glance
The passion light you feel at last
Her pleasure somehow eased the pain
Too late to chance it all again

Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays

There's no emotion
Only passion in your crime
Killing the love that drives you out of your mind
When you dance with a stranger

A spinning room a cool caress
A try to hide my loneliness
Cheek to cheek we let the evening drift by

The hollow mask has disappeared
We drown our love through salty tears
We speed at night like a racing car
And now I see you as you really are

Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays

There's no emotion
Only passion in your crime
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger

Dance
Dance with a stranger
Dance

Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays

There's no emotion
Only passion in your crime
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger

Watching and waiting
For the moment to arrive
Dance with a stranger
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger

There's no emotion
Only passion in your crime
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger
